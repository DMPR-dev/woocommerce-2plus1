# A 2+1 Plugin for WooCoomerce
This plugin provides an ability to make an action "2+1", each 3rd item on WooCommerce cart produces one free item(the cheapest one on the cart). Only logic / tech part, no GUI.

# Screenshot / Example
As we may see, there are 9 products in a cart and 3 of the cheapest ones are free. 
Adding 3 items makes 1 free,<br>
6 items -> 2, <br>
9 -> 3, <br>
12 -> 4 and so on.<br>
